## SCPSwap

### ⚠️ Warning 
This is an **EXPERIMENTAL** version of SCPSwap. We do not recommend using this on a production server; however, if you choose to do so, use it at your own risk.

### "Why did you decide to fork this?"
I wanted specific features, such as:
* Blocking **SCP-079** when there are fewer than 2 SCPs.
* Blocking **SCP-3114**.
* A subcommand to add a **random SCP selector**.

### "Why not use other plugins?"
Because I'm insane :3
